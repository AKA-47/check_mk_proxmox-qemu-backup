 This check runs on Proxmox Servers.

 It reads all configs in the direcotry /etc/pve/qemu-server/.
 For each VM guest found a service is created. The service read all
 logfiles under /var/log/vzdump/ and parses it.

 The service gets {critical} if no backup exists or the backup is
 older than 30 hours. It gets {warning} if the backup is older than 26 hours.

 The {critical} and {warning} limits can be configured in WATO.
 The check can also be disabled for a VM guest.
 It's possible to configure a global rule with matches
 all hosts (and then affects all backups). On the opposite you can configure
 rules, which applies to one specific service on one host only.
 It's possible to define the duration of the backup-process.
 In this time the checks stays {ok} if the backup task is currently running.

 See WATO -> Host & Service Parameters. Search for proxmox.

 Newly created VM guest are displayed as new service by the check_mk
 inventory check.
